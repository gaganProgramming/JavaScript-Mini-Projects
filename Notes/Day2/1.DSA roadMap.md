To become **perfect in DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** for JavaScript (or any language), you need to master both **core concepts** and **problem-solving techniques**. Here's a structured list of **DSA concepts** you should be thorough with — organized by **fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and patterns**.

---

### ✅ **1. Basics (Must-Know JavaScript Concepts)**
- Variables, arrays, objects
- Functions, recursion
- Time & space complexity (Big O notation)
- ES6+ features (like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`)

---

### 📦 **2. Core Data Structures**

#### 🧺 Arrays & Strings
- Traversing, searching, sorting
- Sliding Window Technique
- Two Pointers
- In-place reversal, rotation
- String manipulation

#### 🗃️ Hash Tables / Maps / Sets
- Frequency counters
- Detecting duplicates
- Anagrams
- HashMap-based problems

#### 📚 Stack & Queue
- LIFO & FIFO usage
- Bracket validation
- Min/max stack
- Queue with stacks

#### 🔗 Linked Lists
- Singly & doubly linked lists
- Reverse a linked list
- Detect cycles (Floyd’s algorithm)
- Merge two lists

#### 🌳 Trees
- Binary trees, binary search trees (BST)
- Preorder, inorder, postorder traversal (DFS)
- Level-order traversal (BFS)
- Lowest common ancestor
- Height, balance, diameter

#### 🗺️ Graphs
- Adjacency list/matrix
- BFS, DFS
- Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Topological sort
- Cycle detection
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

#### 📊 Heaps & Priority Queues
- Min-heap, max-heap
- Use in problems like K-largest/smallest

---

### 🔁 **3. Algorithms**

#### 🔍 Searching
- Linear search
- Binary search
- Search in rotated array

#### 🔃 Sorting
- Bubble, Selection, Insertion
- Merge Sort (O(n log n))
- Quick Sort
- Count Sort (non-comparison)

#### 🔗 Recursion & Backtracking
- Subsets, permutations, combinations
- N-Queens
- Maze/Path problems
- Sudoku solver

#### 🧠 Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Memoization vs Tabulation
- Fibonacci, climbing stairs
- Knapsack, coin change
- Longest common subsequence
- DP on strings, grids, trees

---

### 📌 **4. Important Problem-Solving Patterns**
These are essential to crack **LeetCode / FAANG** interviews:

- **Sliding Window**
- **Two Pointers**
- **Fast & Slow Pointers (Floyd’s Cycle)**
- **Merge Intervals**
- **Binary Search on Answer**
- **Backtracking**
- **Greedy**
- **Topological Sort**
- **Trie (Prefix Trees)**

---

### 🧠 Final Goals:
- Be able to **solve 150–300 LeetCode problems** (easy to hard)
- Understand when and **why** to use a particular data structure
- Practice **mock interviews** or pair programming sessions
